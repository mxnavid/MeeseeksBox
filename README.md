This is a project assigned to the students of the Computer Science II class.
The main goal of this project is to implement a Path Builder Game in which there will
be 2 players. The main goal of the players are to reach from one end to the other 
end of the board. Whichever player is able to go across the board will win the game.

In this project my main goal was to develop a player which will be able to efficiently win the game with the as least moves possible. I used Bread First Search to keep track of the visited nodes. I used Dijkstra's algorithm to find the lowest cost path and get the list of the moves to make to reach the other end of the board.
